## Credits

I learned through the course in Code Institute. I do most learning of different open source on 3WC it helps to remember what the code used tags and style CSS for HTML and CSS, also what I am interested in as scroll smooth, icons, and transitions. I did a few learning to CodePen. 

My mentor had good feedback and helps to my process improvement on site project. 

## Here is my projects: 
________________

### Contents

* I was interested in the active current on the section page. I took the jQuery, it comes from [CodePen.](https://codepen.io/arjunamgain/pen/RwWoQM)  

### Favicon 
* I use previous website which is now not on the server anymore. I copied the folder here and replace the icon image through photoshop. 

See the imagthe e iconthe  on the head of the site
![](assets/images/ReadMe-image/Icon.png)


### Social media icons

* I took the social media icon from the [3CWhool.](https://www.freepiimageree-vector/social-media-logo-collection_3966112.htm#query=social%20media%20icon&position=7&from_view=keyword) 

### Specifies size screen for responsive
* I searched and icon the link [Screen size responsive,](https://screensiz.es/monitor) it helps me to know the exact screen size from Desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile devices for the queries media responsiveness.

* I use MacBook pro laptop with a 17” screen and it is very hard to know approx for a large desktop screen. I had experienced difficulty knowing the exact screen size. 

### What I did using queries media list in the CSS.

``` markdown
/*Desktop responsive*/
@media only screen and (max-width: 2070px) {…………}
```

``` markdown
 /* large tablet and small laptop responsive*/
 @media only screen and (max-width: 1354px)  {…………}
```

``` markdown
/*tablet responsive from 650px up to 950px) */
 @media only screen and (max-width: 950px)  {…………}
```

``` markdown
/* large mobile, from 450px up to 750px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 750px) {…………}
```

``` markdown
/* mobile standard responsiveness  for max 450px screen*/
@media only screen and (max-width: 450px)  {…………}
```

``` markdown
 /* small mobile responsiveness  for max 350px screen*/
 @media only screen and (max-width: 350px) {…………}
```

``` markdown
/* smaller mobile  responsiveness */
@media only screen and (max-width: 320px)  {…………}
```

### The dash button icon

* I took an icon dash button from [3WC School.](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_icon_buttons.asp)

### Timeline 

* I did create my own CSS for the timeline history. I had experienced difficulty with a responsive timeline. I decide to copy from [3WC School for the timeline](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_timeline) and I had a few modifications to make the position fit the screen and also responsiveness. The reason is to prevent my time delay. 


### Media

* All the images come from Michael Collins’s Wikimedia and are free to share and link the images and embed a file from Wikimedia. It is in the public domain.

* I like the two images on my site of the project. The mentor pointed out the rights of the images  who are holders' rights. I was concerned about the images, I asked one of the Cohort Facilitators. He instructed me to use a reference and give an example:

``` markdown
