## Credits

I was nervous to do projects because I had experienced how difficult through javascript where I studied for Multimedia BA degree. I started project 2, I found it was extremely difficult all over again. My concept was before start developing the site and turn out I was not able to full completed which are get result, age group and time up game. I had spend to learning other resource a lot of time. I tried to understand the javascript but I was disppointed because I could not understand what they have explaining. Cause it was not my first English language. 

My mentor had good feedback and helps with my process improvement on site project.

## Adobe Photoshop & Illustrate

It is free licence. I choose a roll movie image and edited to create a logo where I used Adobe Illustrate. 
* The layout movie poster on the front page which comes from [www.wallpaperflare.com/](www.wallpaperflare.com/), It is free to allow download who wish to use wallpaper on the usernames' desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile.
* I downloaded three movie posters:
